# Human-Error-Identification-in-Human-Computer-Interaction

The file ”experiment.csv” contain the data collected for an experiment to calculate the time to move an object (on the screen) of width w a distance d.
The first row represents the distance traveled d.
The second row represents the object width w.
The rest rows represent the time (in ms) taken by a user Ui to move a circle of radius = w a distance d.
1. Plot the graph time average vs. wd .
2. Plot the graph time standard deviation vs. wd .
3. Plot the graph time median vs. wd .
4. Select the three columns with the smallest means, and plot the graph user vs. time. You will have three graphs, one for each column.
5. Select the three columns with the smallest standard deviation, and plot the graph user vs. time. You will have three graphs, one for each column.
6. Select the three columns with the smallest medians, and plot the graph user vs. time. You will have three graphs, one for each column.
7. What are your conclusions as it relates to width vs. distance? If the w represents a button size, what will you select using this experiment?
